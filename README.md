- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [@EosisWasTaken](http://eosiswastaken.github.io) ! I'm a teenager from France learning to code. In the future, I'd like to work in the IT industry, but I ddon't really know where, or what specific job tho. For now I'm learning Python and I'm having fun building little projects, and I'll soon learn JavaScript ! 
- I enjoy making discord bots, little games, and proofs of concept, looots of them.
- This GitHub is the only place where I'll post everything about programming, since I don't have a website, or other programming related social medias.
